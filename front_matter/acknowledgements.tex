    Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude towards my outstanding supervisors, Dr. Katerina Kaouri and Dr. Thomas Woolley. They have both worked extremely hard to guide me through this project and introduce me to the field of academic research. Even through a pandemic, they have both put every effort into supporting me. I would like to thank them for their patience, wisdom and encouragement. I am so grateful for the opportunity to have worked with them both and hope to do so again in the future.
    
    I would like to thank Prof. Karl Swann, of the Cardiff University School of Biosciences. Without him, this project would not have been possible. I will cherish many fascinating conversations we had about his work and the use of mathematical modelling in the world of biology.
    
    I would also like express my thanks to all of the staff and students in the School of Mathematics. I feel truly lucky to be continuing my studies here with them all. Namely, I'm extremely grateful for the friendships I have made in Lucy, Josh, Tim, and  Abhishek.
    
    Finally, I'd like to thank my parents for their support throughout my studies. Their work ethic has always been my inspiration.
